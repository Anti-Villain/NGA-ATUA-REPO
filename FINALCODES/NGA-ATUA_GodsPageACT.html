It can be calm and life-giving, or dangerous and destructive. This energy is called Tangaroa.

When Tāwhirimātea was venting his anger on his brothers, both Rongo and Haumiatiketike, took refuge in the body of Papa, mother earth, who hid them until the storm passed. In the Māori language, ‘rongo’ means peace. Rongo is generally portrayed as the creator of the kūmara, a plant associated with peace.</p>

Because of this he was subjected to the fury of his brother Tāwhirimātea, who would have killed him if their mother had not hidden him in her body, that is, in the ground. While he escaped from Tāwhirimātea, he was later discovered by Tū, god of war (here representing humankind), who saw Haumia's hair sticking up out of the earth. Haumia contrasts with his brother Rongo, the god of the kūmara and all cultivated plants.</p>

After Rangi and Papa were separated by their sons, Rangi cried, and his tears flooded the land. To stop this, the sons decided to turn Papa face down, so Rangi and Papa could no longer see each other's sorrow. Rūaumoko was at his mother's breast when this happened, so he was carried into the world below. He was given fire for warmth by Tama-kaka, and his movements below the earth cause earthquakes and volcanoes.</p>
